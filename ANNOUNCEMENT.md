# Announcing SynApps v0.4.0 Alpha Release

We're thrilled to announce the Alpha release of **SynApps v0.4.0** ‚Äì a web-based visual platform that lets you build and orchestrate modular AI agents with ease!

## üöÄ What is SynApps?

SynApps is a visual platform that empowers creators to build autonomous AI workflows by connecting specialized AI "applets" like LEGO blocks. Each applet performs a specific task (writing, image generation, memory storage), and our lightweight orchestrator routes messages between them to solve complex problems collaboratively.

- **Real-Time Execution**: Watch your AI agents work with animated visualization
- **Persistent Storage**: Save workflows and results for later reference

## üîß Built for Developers

SynApps v0.4.0 includes:
- Modern React/TypeScript frontend with React Flow
