# SynApps v0.4.0 - Alpha Release Notes

We're excited to announce the Alpha release of SynApps v0.4.0, a web-based visual platform for modular AI agents with database persistence and improved workflow execution.

## What is SynApps?

SynApps is a **web-based visual platform for modular AI agents**. Its mission is to let indie creators build autonomous AI applets like LEGO blocks â€“ each applet is a specialized agent with a skill (e.g., *Writer*, *Memory*, *Artist*). 

A lightweight **SynApps Orchestrator** routes messages between these applets, sequencing their interactions to solve tasks collaboratively. In other words, SynApps connects AI "synapses" (agents) in real time, forming an intelligent network that can tackle complex workflows.

## Key Features in v0.4.0

### Core Features
- **Visual Workflow Editor**: Create AI workflows with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Real-Time Execution**: Watch your AI agents work in real-time with animated workflow visualization
- **Persistent Storage**: Save workflows and execution results to a database for later reference
- **Workflow History**: Review past workflow runs and their outputs
- **WebSocket Updates**: Real-time status updates during workflow execution

### Applets
- **Writer Applet**: Generate text content using OpenAI's GPT-4 models
- **Artist Applet**: Create images from text descriptions using Stability AI's diffusion models
- **Memory Applet**: Store and retrieve context information between workflow steps

### Technical Improvements
- **Async Database Operations**: Full async/await pattern for database operations with SQLAlchemy
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic for managing database schema changes
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Type-safe React components with TypeScript
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Backend and frontend test suites with CI/CD integration
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment with Docker Compose
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Production-ready Kubernetes manifests

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Node.js 16+ and Python 3.9+ (for local development)
- API keys for OpenAI and Stability AI

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your API keys
3. Run `docker-compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up --build`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

For detailed setup instructions, see the [README.md](README.md).

## Known Limitations

This is an Alpha release with the following known limitations:

- Limited error handling for edge cases
- Basic input validation for workflow configurations
- Limited set of applets (Writer, Artist, Memory)
- No user authentication/authorization system yet
- Limited documentation for custom applet development

## Roadmap

Future releases will focus on:

- Expanding the applet ecosystem
- Enhancing error handling and input validation
- Adding user authentication and multi-user support
- Improving documentation and developer experience
- Performance optimizations for large workflows
